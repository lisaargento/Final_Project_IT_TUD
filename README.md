# Final_Project_IT_TUD
Final project for my IT class in Bolton Street TUD


The purpose of this final project was to improve the presentation and usability of the website by implementing a CSS framework, integrating external data, and deploying it on the internet. I build the website from the previous web page I have done (webpage for a mix of an association and a construction company).

## Design plan
I considered the following elements to enhance the website's presentation and usability:
-	Colour scheme. I choose a colour scheme that reflects the themes developed on the website: the construction industry and nature. Contrasting colors were used to improve readability and visual appeal. For example, red was selected to indicate hazards in the Safety Alerts page.
-	Typography. Clear and legible fonts were chosen for headings, subheadings, and body text. Consistency in font styles was maintained throughout the website.
-	Images and Icon. Relevant images and icons were incorporated to visually represent the goals of the association, as well as various aspects such as team members and activities.
-	Organization/Layout. Information was organized logically using display flex. For more complex website we maybe should prioritize grids and columns to maintain visual balance and alignment.
-	Navigation. The user-friendly and responsive navigation bar was designed to ensure easy access to different sections of the website. 


## Development decision
-	Bootstrap was chosen as the CSS framework due to its wide range of pre-built components and responsive design features and we learned to use it in class, making it suitable for rapid development and customization.  While I didn't heavily rely on framework classes, as I started from my previous assignment. I found it beneficial for adding specific behaviors and maintaining consistency. I think it is easier to manage its own class than to try to find equivalent in a framework. However, it can be very helpful to add specific comportments. Moreover, I think that in a larger project the design is very important, and it is consider in advance so it can be easier to keep coherence, have a good look and feel and suitable colour scheme and fonts it may be easier to utilize a framework.
-	I have decided to integrate real-time weather updates as external data into the safety part of the website because it defines the conditions on site for construction. This integration provides users with up-to-date information about on-site construction conditions, improving the overall usefulness of the website.

I eventually deploy the local web project using GitHub and Vercel. The final website is deployed on a web server, ensuring that it is accessible to users via the internet. I added all needed files in a new repository in my GitHub account. Then I sign up for an account on Vercel and import the GitHub project to deploy it.
